##### Description:

Ohsoartsy is a python script that outputs an html file for a movie trailer website. Each movie is presented as a tile with a movie poster image, title and director/year. Hovering over the tile displays the movie's plot. Clicking on a tile opens an overlay with the movie's trailer.

It is a static html page, the movie information is hardcoded into the file `entertainment_center.py`. The file `media.py` provides the Movie() class, which is used to generate the instances of the movies.
